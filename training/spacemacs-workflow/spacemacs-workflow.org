#+TITLE: Spacemacs Workflow
#+AUTHOR: Stephen Heywood


* Objective

By following two users, Alex and Sam we will see how they use Spacemacs and GitLab on a number of tasks.

This document will walk through a number of workflow scenarios using a number of diagrams to show key steps in sequence while working with Spacemacs and GitLab.
Each diagram shows a series of events that happen in sequence by placing them at a lower position on the diagram, i.e. time flows down the diagram.

To keep the following introduction easy for new users to Spacemacs and GitLab the version numbers shown are not technically correct but still cover the general idea of having a history for any work saved to the history log.

* Initial file edit/save

Alex has a document that they want to update and then save.

* Sync work to GitLab

With the changes saved, Alex now needs to sync the changes to GitLab.

For this example, Alex has changed the file =welcome.txt=.
Before these new changes are part of the local history we need to add it to a list of changes that have happened to the local history.
This process is called /Staging/.

Pressing =s= while the "white block" (called, the /point/) is on /Unstaged changes/ will start this process.

which then should switch to /Staged changes/.

If the /point/ as shown below is located somewhere else then you will likely get another prompt

Spacemacs sometimes may need some help to know what needs to be /staged/. So, you need to select or type the filename and then press enter.

After confirming the file to stage, the listed /staged/ files should update.

If for some reason you /Stage/ the wrong file, you can press =u= to /Unstage/ it.
Also, if you want to check out what each letter is for, then just press =?= to get the list for the current context.

Now that we have =welcome.txt= /Staged/, let's confirm this file change with a message to the local history.
This process is called /Committing/.

* Issue when trying to sync work to GitLab

At a later stage, Alex is again trying to sync another set of local changes to GitLab.
The issue now is that GitLab has a been updated with a different history and files which Alex doesn't have on his computer, therefore when trying to sync to GitLab it will now fail.
We will solve this issue in the next section.
