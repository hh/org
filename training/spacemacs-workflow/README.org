* Objective

The reader should gain practical knowledge, skills, and confidence while progressing through the following material on Spacemacs.

To help with the pace and focus of the material, it will concentrate on various scenarios.
These scenarios will present two users, Alex and Sam, as they look to complete different tasks.
In time, they will explore several tools Spacemacs provides to interact with other technologies as well.

** What is Spacemacs?

At its core, Spacemacs is just a text editor with an amazing array of options waiting to help the user be more productive.
With practice, a user can move between various tasks with ease resulting in greater productivity.
Welcome to a new way of working and experiencing technology.
