 with the code below you can hit a comma to complete the current choice of email
 address and start searching for the next one. This matches the behaviour of
 many other email clients like Gmail or Thunderbird.

 This won’t change anybody’s world, but gives you a nice little thrill of
 efficiency when entering several recipients to an email!

The article recommends Brave and Pi-Hole, as well.

For folks looking for simplest anti ads and tracking browser should consider
[[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15049171][Firefox Focus]] instead of Brave. It is light and works like a breeze on
lowest of configurations.

And folks using Android not bothered enough to setup Pi-Hole should consider
using Intra with nextdns or adguard-dns [1].

I've installed Intra for friends and family on their phones, on their
AndroidTVs... It takes a quick one minute setup and another minute to show them
how to use it. Esp, nextdns' analytics dashboard is a real eye-opener for them.
When they actually see the results, they start taking notice and are bothered
enough to figure out how to blacklist additional domains.

Google is  rapidly becoming  persona non-grata  in my  view. There  is something
really, for the lack of a better word,  scummy about it in the last year or two.
We partnered  with them on  their DialogueFlow platform (voice  recognition) for
Google  Home integration  and voice  command  intent handling  and they  totally
screwed us over. I won't/can't go into  the specifics but it was bizarre; we had
no recourse except taking a near trillion dollar company to court. We decided it
was not worth it and wrote off the cost and took a hit but never again.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Most people don't realise this, but on Android, setting private-dns [0] or
 using local VPN apps like blockada / dns66 or intra+nextdns [1] /
 intra+adguard-dns [2] would block ads even within apps, provided they aren't
 doing their own name resolution [3]. It allows one to use Chrome for websites
 that don't work well or at all with Firefox+plugins; in addition to helping
 bypass censorship.

This might be of use to process audit logs in real time.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Why use Storm? Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime
 computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams
 of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing.
 Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun
 to use!

 Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning,
 continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a
 benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. It
 is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, and is
 easy to set up and operate.

 Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A
 Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in
 arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the
 computation however needed. Read more in the tutorial.

They seemed to have mode away from clojure as it was difficult to onboard folks
to write it for an open source project. I wonder what the onboarding process was like?

 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I can attest to this fact, as part of a unicorn upstart with dev offices in Sao
 Paulo and Berlin. Clojure onboarding has never been a major roadblock for new
 engineers. And we never hire asking for "X years of lang experience". Almost
 everyone in the (~300 strong) engineering team started with zero-to-little
 Clojure background.

 Thank you, this is very timely: recently I got a cold email from an acquisition editor too and been researching this fascinating topic of writing tech books. :)
 Some more helpful resources I found:

 - "I wrote a book" by Tryggvi Björgvinsson: https://dev.to/trickvi/i-wrote-a-book-lfg

 - "Writing a technical book" by Ian Miell: https://zwischenzugs.com/2016/05/15/writing-a-technical-book...

 - Then there are some good discussion about this topic on HN. You can try searching by keywords like "ask hn + writing a book", e.g.: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14300932

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Remote Browser is a library for controlling web browsers like Chrome and Firefox programmatically using JavaScript. You've likely heard of similar browser automation frameworks before, such as Puppeteer and Selenium. Much like these other projects, Remote Browser can be used to accomplish a wide variety of tasks relating to UI testing, Server Side Rendering (SSR), and web scraping. What makes Remote Browser different from these other libraries is that it's built using standard cross-browser compatible technologies, and its primary goal is to facilitate interactions with existing APIs rather than to create a new one of its own.
