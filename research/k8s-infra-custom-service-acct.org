#+TITLE: K8s Infra Custom Service Acct
Working on:
https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/2262#issuecomment-869854631
Do not create service accounts in groups

#+begin_src
Given correct permissions the ii-service account can access production logs

To achieve this I need to:
ensure the role exists that has the needed permissions
ensure the service account exists
bind the service account to the role
#+end_src

Find the permissions needed for the role:
https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/2cfeed5bacb9f82b3aff1722326e3bec5b5528fc/audit/projects/k8s-artifacts-prod/buckets/k8s-artifacts-gcslogs/iam.json
shows me
the group: k8s-infra-gcs-access-logs@kubernetes.io
is assigned to the role: "roles/storage.objectViewer"
Available GCS roles
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles
This confirms roles/storage.objectViewer is the most appropriate role
It contains:
- resourcemanager.projects.get
- resourcemanager.projects.list
- storage.objects.get
- storage.objects.list
