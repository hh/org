Our [[file:Tiltfile::k8s_yaml(kustomize('.'))][./Tiltfile]] uses the [[file:kustomization.yaml::kind:%20Kustomization][./kustomization.yaml]] to figure out what resources to
deploy. Changes to any file referenced will result in immediate changes to the
deployed resources. If [[file:Tiltfile::docker_build(][docker_build()]] entries are uncommented, those images will
be rebuilt, pushed, and pods restarted automatically.
