#+TITLE: Community Infra

#+begin_quote
ii's local Bay of Plenty community infrastucture for learning, developing, and pairing with locals.
#+end_quote

* Plan
Provide local infrastructure, through servers that run Kubernetes; For an automated, reproducable, and accessible way to those in the local community.

We will begin using Kubeadm for setting up Kubernetes, but will end up using Talos as the way to bring up Kubernetes.

* Network
There are currently three servers installed, their IPs are:
- 10.8.11.201
- 10.8.11.202
- 10.8.11.203

* Set up Kubernetes
** Prepare
