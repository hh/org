#+TITLE: Prepare RPis Sidero

The purpose of this doc is to run throught the process of preparing the Sidero deployment and Raspberry Pi 4Bs for management. It closely mirrors the documentation of [[https://www.sidero.dev/docs/v0.3/guides/rpi4-as-servers/][Sidero]] but is more specific for ii's local-cluster and is org-ified.

* Download EEPROM for Network booting
Save this in the Downloads folder.
#+begin_src tmate :window prepare
(
  cd ~/Downloads
  curl -O -L https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/releases/download/v2021.04.29-138a1/rpi-boot-eeprom-recovery-2021-04-29-vl805-000138a1-network.zip
  ls ~/Downloads/rpi-boot-eeprom-recovery-*-network.zip
)
#+end_src

* Format the SD card
#+begin_src tmate :window prepare
DEVICE=/dev/sdb1
if mount | grep -q "${DEVICE}"; then
    echo "'${DEVICE}' is still mounted." > /dev/stderr
fi
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1
#+end_src

Next, mount the SD card.

* Extract the network recovery
Insert an SD card and prepare the drive

#+begin_src tmate :window prepare
DRIVE=/var/run/media/${USER}/*
echo ${DRIVE}

unzip -d ${DRIVE} ~/Downloads/rpi-boot-eeprom-recovery-*-network.zip
#+end_src
(presumes one device connected)

Next, unmount the SD card.

* Flash the EEPROM
With the display connected, insert the SD card into the slot in the RPi and boot it.
The flash will be complete when the screen is green.

* Boot into network recovery
Removing the SD card, boot the RPi into the network recovery.
