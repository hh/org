* something cool
this is something cool and my thoughts /on it/.
I can do small code blocks
: print("like so")


* something fun
I can also do bigger code blocks
#+begin_src js
console.log("like so")
#+end_src
* Inline code
there are a couple ways to do inline code
** code block
you use = for this to make =inline code=
** preformatted
you use ~ for this to make ~preformatted text~
* something sassy
I can make a nice list of things:
- oranges
- bananas
- apples

can I also do definitions?
- something :: is cool

- veranda :: a covered patio
