I've been playing around with and learning Envoy for a number of months now. One of the concepts I'm investigating is rewriting the request's host.
Envoy is a super powerful piece of software. It is flexible and highly dynamic.

* Journey
** My expectations
The goal is to set up Envoy on a host to rewrite all requests dynamically back to a container registry hosted by a cloud-provider, such as GCP.

** Initial discoveries
One of the first things I investigated was the ability to get traffic from one site and serve it on another (proxying).
I searched in the docs and in their [[https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.17.1/start/quick-start/configuration-static][most basic example]] could see that, by using envoy's http filter in the filter_chains, a static host could be rewritten.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
...
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 10000
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          access_log:
          - name: envoy.access_loggers.file
            typed_config:
              "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.access_loggers.file.v3.FileAccessLog
              path: /dev/stdout
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.filters.http.router
          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: local_service
              domains: ["*"]
              routes:
              - match:
                  prefix: "/"
                route:
                  host_rewrite_literal: www.envoyproxy.io
                  cluster: service_envoyproxy_io
...
#+END_SRC

This is a great start! This serves the site and its content under the host where Envoy is served.
However, the host in the rewrite is static and not dynamic. It seems at this point like doing the implementation this way is not viable.

** Learning about filter-chains
Envoy has the lovely feature to set many kinds of middleware in the middle of a request.
This middleware can be used to add/change/remove things from the request.
Envoy is particularly good at HTTP related filtering. It also supports such features as dynamic forward proxy, JWT auth, health checks, and rate limiting.

The functionality is infinitely useful as filters can be such things as gRPC, PostgreSQL, Wasm, and even Lua.

** The implementation
Once I found the ability to write Lua as a filter, I found that it provided enough capability to perform the dynamic host rewrite.

With envoy running this config, the behaviour of the requests is
- rewrite all traffic hitting the web service to /k8s.gcr.io/
- except if the IP is /192.168.0.1/ then set the location to /registry-1.docker.io/

Since I'm using a [[https://github.com/sharingio/pair][Pair]] instance, it sets the local subnet to /192.168.0.0/24/ so when I try to =docker pull humacs-envoy-10000.$SHARINGIO_PAIR_BASE_DNS_NAME/library/postgres:12-alpine= it will go to /docker.io/.

On my local machine, pulling container images using =docker pull humacs-envoy-10000.$SHARINGIO_PAIR_BASE_DNS_NAME/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.26= will instead use /k8s.gcr.io/.

To achieve this, I research how other http libraries handle redirects - namely [[https://golang.org/src/net/http/server.go?s=66471:66536#L2179][Golang's net/http.Redirect]].
The main things that Golang's /http.Redirect/ does is:
- set the /content-type/ header to /text/html/
- set the location to the destination
- set the status code to 302
- set the body to the same data in earlier steps, but in an /a/ tag.

* Final thoughts
I'm learning that Envoy is highly flexible and seemly limitless in it's capabilities.

It's exciting to see Envoy being adopted in so many places - moreover to see the diverse usecases and implementations.

Big shout out to [[https://ii.coop/author/zach-mandeville][Zach]] for pairing on this with a few different aspects and attempts! (Zach is cool:tm:)
