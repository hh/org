If you'd like to get in touch with ii, Brenda is your first point of contact.

At ii, Brenda Peel seamlessly manages and coordinates all things from start to finish. There is nothing too big for Brenda to conquer. And she does it all with a smile.

She enjoys experimenting with new recipes (curry, anyone?) and enjoying all that New Zealand has to offer.
