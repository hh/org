## Introduction {#introduction}

In this, we'll ramp up our abilities by adding testing into the mix!
Like session 2, we will edit, make, and run commands like kubectl, but now checking our builds with unit testing, using go test.
With these tests, we'll have increased confidence in contributing our work back upstream and so we'll also talk about pull requests, and the PR pre-submission practices.


## Agenda {#agenda}

-   Setup our Dev environments
-   introduce unit tests
-   testing with go test and make
-   PR's
-   An intro to prow and test grid
