## Funding 3D printed astronomy

We got together with people who create and code at the [osos.nz](http://osos.nz) [hackathon](http://hackathon.opensourceopensociety.com/) to innovate together on opensource projects.

[Arturo Pelayo](http://www.arturopelayo.com/) uses 3D Printed Astronomy to allow the **blind to experience the stars** at [Tactile Astronomy](http://twitter.com/tactileedu).

* Tactile Astronomy needed hardware for augmenting their 3D Prints /_which was funded_/
* They also need software to coordinate human interactions with hardware /_needs funding_/

[Gardner Bickford](https://github.com/gardner) is making it easy for people to **vote with your money** at [Cobudget](https://twitter.com/cobudget)

* [OS//OS](http://osos.nz) gave everyone at the conference $5 to spend
* they invited us to create [bucket to fund hardware](http://cobudget.co/#/buckets/662)
* the hardware was [full funded](https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/771418829364731904) by the close of the conference

[ii](ii.delivery) wants to **give them both a platform for shared innovation**:

* to collaboratively edit shared code on a website
* and have that code running on real hardware instantly

We look forward to working closely with Arturo and Gardner in the coming weeks to help them innovate openly together.
