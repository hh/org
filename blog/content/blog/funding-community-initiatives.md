_If you want to [@cobudget](https://twitter.com/cobudget) with us, write your email and [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chilli4change) on an physical envelope with your contribution and drop it by in person at 148 Durham Street, Tauranga._

Your sharing of community wants, values, and feelings at [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chilli4change) Friday now meets a _call to action!_

You wanted Thai or Mexican for our next meal. You also wanted to invite [Arturo Pelayo](http://www.arturopelayo.com/) from [Tactile Astronomy](https://twitter.com/tactileedu)

We all put money into envelopes with our emails on them, so we could [@cobudget](https://twitter.com/cobudget) together to decide what to eat and how to get our next speaker here!

You will now have received an email from iiCobudget:

You can [see how it works](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQYKxhHwKuQGmOMPpoE8Eo0XMuw1yn55Bjgsh6-D0eQ/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=5000&slide=id.ge08287da5_10_0), but we are going to go ahead and walk through clicking on getting started.

You just need to fill in your name, and choose a password.

Now you have the opportunity to allocate the money from your envelope into existing idea buckets or create your own!

Looking forward to seeing us host [Arturo](http://www.arturopelayo.com/) at the next [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chilli4change)!
