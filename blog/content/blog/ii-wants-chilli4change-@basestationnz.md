We hope this initial [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/773276669020778497) provides a forum for a _heated_ discussion of innovation around an (optionally) spicy meal brought to you by [ii](http://blog.ii.delivery).

ii wants to help [Tactile Astronomy](https://twitter.com/tactileedu/status/772705366891048960) provide a tactile experience of the heavens to blind youth

ii invites you to participate to a conversation about innovation over [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chilli4change) as we collaborativly invite one of these organizations to speak in Tauranga

Our resident [Hippie Hacker](http://twitter.com/hippiehacker) at [basestation.nz](basestation.nz) will be demoing some collaboration technology that enables continous innovation.

We look forward to a *heated discussion* over a meal of Texas Vegan Chilli.

```

We hope to do this again. To collaboratively fund the next event,
there will be koha buckets for chilli based food dishes from other cultures. (in addition to help host the next speaker)
