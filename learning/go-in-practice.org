* Part 1. Background and fundamentals

** Chapter 1. Getting into Go

*** 1.1. What is Go?
*** 1.2. Noteworthy aspects of Go

**** 1.2.1. Multiple return values
[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/returns.go][chapter1/returns.go]]
[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/returns2.go][chapter1/returns2.go]]

***** Direct Linking to code
You can open these and type ~, x x~ to run  =spacemacs/go-run-main=
[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/returns.go][chapter1/returns.go]]
***** INCLUDING the src

~, '~ to open this included file in a dedicated buffer.
~, x x~ to run =spacemacs/go-run-main=
The file (and specific lines) will be included in the export.

#+INCLUDE: "./go-in-practice/chapter1/returns.go" src go :lines "11-18"

***** Inline Code Execution and output

#+NAME: Names
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func Names() (string, string) {
return "Foo", "Bar"
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: header
#+BEGIN_SRC go

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: main
#+BEGIN_SRC go
Foo Bar
Foo
#+END_SRC

- The "underscore" character ~_~ is used to tell the compiler that "I don't care about this variable or it's content"

**** 1.2.2. A modern standard library
[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/read_status.go][chapter1/read_status.go]]
#+INCLUDE: "./go-in-practice/chapter1/read_status.go" src go

#+NAME: Listing 13 Read TCP status: read_status.go
#+BEGIN_SRC go :imports '("fmt" "bufio" "net")
	conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "golang.org:80")
	fmt.Fprintf(conn, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
	status, _ := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
	fmt.Println(status)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: Listing 13 Read TCP status: read_status.go
#+begin_EXPORT text
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
#+end_EXPORT

- Networking and HTTP
  - (net package)
  - TCP / UDP 
  - client or server role
  - bufio package
- Package bufio implements buffered I/O. It wraps an io.Reader or io.Writer object, creating another object (Reader or Writer) that also implements the interface but provides buffering and some help for textual I/O. 


Go - encoding is UTF-8 internally


- interfaces (review more)

- HTML
  - Includes support through ~html~ and ~html/template~ packages
- Cryptography
  - Includes support for common cryptography protocols, SHA, TLS, AES and HMAC
- Data Encoding
  - packages -> turn a JSON string into instantiated objects



**** 1.2.3. Concurrency with goroutines and channels

- Go scheduler
- "multiple processing cores is now the norm"
- Other languages (aka Ruby) have a "global thread lock" - which hampers running routines in parallel
- "goroutine" , a function that can be run concurrently to the main program or other goroutines. Sometimes dubbed lightweight threads"
  - Figure 1.2 Goroutines running in threads distributed on the available processing cores
  - Listing 1.5 Concurrent output
    - two functions printing concurrently
    - function ~count()~ is run in parallel using the keyword ~go~, e.g. ~go count()~
    - This causes main to continue executing immediately without needing the count() function to finish first.
  
[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/goroutine.go][chapter1/go_routine.go]]
#+INCLUDE: "./go-in-practice/chapter1/go_routine.go" src go

#+NAME: Listing 1.6 Printing concurrently
#+BEGIN_SRC go :imports '("fmt" "time") :main no
func count() {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
		time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1)
	}
}

func main() {
	go count()
	time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 2)
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
	time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 5)
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: Listing 1.6 Printing concurrently
#+begin_EXPORT text
0
1
Hello World
2
3
4
#+end_EXPORT

- Concurrency: "channels"
  - Channels provide a way for two goroutines to communicate with each other.
  - Channels can be one-directional or bidirectional

[[file:go-in-practice/chapter1/channel.go][chapter1/channel.go]]
#+INCLUDE: "./go-in-practice/chapter1/channel.go" src go

#+NAME: Listing 1.7 Using channels: channel.go
#+BEGIN_SRC go :imports '("fmt" "time") :main no
func printCount(c chan int) {
	num := 0
	for num >= 0 {
		num = <-c
		fmt.Print(num, " ")
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	a := []int{8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9, -1}

	go printCount(c)

	for _, v := range a {
		c <- v
	}
	time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1)
	fmt.Println("End of main")
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: Listing 1.7 Using channels: channel.go
#+begin_EXPORT text
8 6 7 5 3 0 9 -1 End of main
#+end_EXPORT

**** 1.2.4. Go the toolchain—more than a language

- go executable is a toolchain enabling more than a compiler

- package management
  - lightweight
  - built in from day one
  - improve programmer productivity
  - faster compile time
  - syntax: ~import "fmt"~
  - syntax: ~fmt.Println("Hello Word")~
  - list packages in alphabetical order
  - net/http  << imports only http section? from the net package.
  - external packages - reference by URL.
  - command: ~go get~
  - can use most version-control systems ( git - mercurial - SVN and bazaar ) pg 14
  - Go retrieves the codebase from Git and checks out the latest commit from the default branch.
  - Go has no central repository and packages are fetched from their source location.



- testing
  - Essential element of software development
  - syntax: ~import "testing"~
  - testing package provides
    - a command-line runner
    - code-coverage reporting
    - race-condition detection.
  - naming convention for test files: end in ~_test.go~
    - excluded when the application is built
  - Command: ~go test~
    - executes the function that begins with Test e.g. TestName
  - Command: ~go test ./...~
    - Test the current package and the ones nested in subdirectories
  - Test Results
    - Listing 1.12 - PASS
    - Listing 1.13 - FAIL
  - Use other packages for BDD or other testing patterns
  - Code Coverage
    - Command ~go test -cover~
    - Reports the % of coverage provided
    - Listing 1.14 - output
    - Export results to files that be used by other tools (example?)
    - http://blog.golang.org/cover
  - More details on Testing in Chapter 4

#+NAME: Listing 1.10 Hello World: hello.go
#+BEGIN_SRC go :imports '("fmt") :main no

- Formatting
  - Tabs vs Spaces ? Style issues/discussions don't help with developer productivity
  - Idiomatic Go - https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html (Effective Go)
  - Command: ~go fmt~
  - Rewrites all go files to canonical style.
  - Use a hook on save to update the current format

  - Explore: Emacs save hook / pre-git commit
  - Explore: Convert tab to spaces view options

We have some go-lang spacemacs settings to run go fmt on save etc.
Might be interesting to see pre-git commit
http://spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/go/README.html
https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/go

- documentation generation
- compiler
- locate extra options - check: go --help

#+NAME: go extra compiler options
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :epilogue ") 2>&1\n:" :prologue "(\n"
go --help
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: go extra compiler options
#+begin_EXAMPLE

*** 1.3. Go in the vast language landscape

   - Go design was for "systems language", with cloud computing a subset.
   - Not good focus for embedded systems due to the runtime and garbage collection.
   - Alternative to C
   - Go provides a runtime that includes features such as managing threads and garbage collection.
   - Go applications have a sweet spot that provides real productivity.
   - Go compiles to a single binary for an operating system to directly execute.
     - The binary contains the Go runtime, all the imported packages and the entire application.
     - everything needed to run the program is within a single binary
   - Performance between languages isn't straightforward
   - Go is a statically typed language with dynamic-like features.
     - Statically typed languages do type checking based on static code analysis.
     - Go has the ability to do some type switching. Under some circumstances, variables of one type can be turned into variables of a different type.
   - Go has a built-in web server, as illustrated in figure 1.6 (pg 20)

*** 1.4. Getting up and running in Go

- [[http://tour.golang.org][http://tour.golang.org]]
- [[https://play.golang.org][https://play.golang.org]]

**** 1.4.1. Installing Go

- [[https://golang.org/dl/][https://golang.org/dl/]]

**** 1.4.2. Working with Git, Mercurial, and version control

**** 1.4.3. Exploring the workspace

- Go code is expected to be in a workspace.
- Base directory referenced by ~GOPATH~
- workspace has a set directory hierarchy (
  - bin
  - pkg
  - src
- Command ~go install~
  - manages the ~bin~ directory
- archive files ?
  - file suffix .a 
  - stored in the ~pkg~ directory

**** 1.4.4. Working with environment variables

- go executable expect the variable to exist.
- ~export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin~
- An optional environment variable ~GOBIN~ for installing binaries to an alternative location,

*** 1.5. Hello, Go

- Create a web server
