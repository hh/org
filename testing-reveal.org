#+title: Testing Reveal
#+REVEAL_ROOT: ./revealjs

* Intro
We noticed that exporting an org file to a reveal presentation did not work.  Why not?
* Steps
** Make sure i have reveal enabled
on your doom config, you want ot make sure org has the +present plugin
so in yr init.el, the org line should be  at least:
#+begin_src elisp
(org + present)
#+end_src
** Export and see results
When I first exported, I had an unstyled presentation.  Looking into the sourc,e it was trying to grab the CSS and JS from my emacs local packages.
In the latest version of doom, your emacs config is now placed in ~\~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/revealjs~.  This path will cause permission issues, as it's nested within directories with restricted permissions.  I didn't want to change all of this, and pulling from a local directory wouldn't work long-term online, and so I copied down the src to
this org directory, under revealjs
